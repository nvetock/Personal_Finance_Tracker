# Personal Finance Tracker
The goal of this project is to create a lightweight finance tracker that allows a user to easily input income and expenses.\
Transactions will be held as object and utilize a hash table for program related operations. A CSV file will be used for data persistence and allow a user to move the budgeting tool to something like Excel or Sheets. In the future snippets from a CSV to add into the data structure would be nice. 

The command-line program will:
- Allow a user to add, edit, or delete transactions.
- Support income and expense types along with categories for further segmentation
- Persist data using CSV files
- Show summaries of total income, expenses, monthly reports and overall balance
- Allow filtering by category
- Include input validation for correct formats and safe interaction.



## Future Nice-to-haves
- Persistent database hookup
- Budgeting capabilities
- Planning tools
- Some form of visualization
